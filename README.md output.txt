# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

This Python project demonstrates file handling and exception handling concepts. It consists of two parts:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**: The program reads from an existing file (`input.txt`), modifies its content, and writes the modified version to a new file (`output.txt`).
2. **Error Handling Lab**: The program asks the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn't exist or can't be read.

## Files
- **file_handling_error_handling.py**: The main Python file that includes both the file reading/writing and exception handling code.
- **input.txt** (sample file): An example text file to be used for the File Read & Write Challenge.

## Instructions

### Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Make sure you have an `input.txt` file in the same directory or specify your own file when prompted.

### Running the Program:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `file_handling_error_handling.py`.
3. Run the Python program:
   ```bash
   python file_handling_error_handling.py
